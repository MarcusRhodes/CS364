#### 4.2.51.1 Custom Images and Icons

Multiple custom images and icons will be used to verify that users can use custom images to personalize their app.  Testers will test that images upload correctly to the app and that they are also viewable.  An error message will alert the user if the image doesn't upload properly or if it is an unaccepted file type. If there is no network connectivity an error message will alert the user and ask them to try again later.  If images don't display properly, there will be an error where the image should be alerting the user that the image is unviewable.
