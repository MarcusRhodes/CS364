### 4.2.53 Calendar View

Validation will be success if the application loads the user's personal calendar style.  Style options include Day, 5-Day Week, 7-Day Week, Month, Semester, and Year views.

#### 4.2.53.1 Various Calendar Views

Each view style is validated by the user selecting the calendar view style of choice from the dedicated buttons at the top of the calendar display window.  The default style is Month.  The default style is validated upon the initial opening of the calendar application when no previous default has been set in user configuration. If the user desires a different view, the preferred style will be enabled by pressing the respective view style button (i.e. 7-Day Week). When the view style changes to reflect the selected option. 

In the event the preferred style does not change when it's corresponding button has been interacted with, the user will first exit out of the application and attempt the operation again. If, after subsequent attempts, the perferred style is not enabled, the user can contact support for further troubleshooting.
