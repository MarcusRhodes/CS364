### 3.2.10 Collapsible Calendar

When the user views the Calendar, each day will contain a list of events for that given day. At first, only one event is shown, but the user can choose to show all of them by tapping a button labeled 'Show all'. The user's device will also be able to adjust the size of the calendar and have the calendar items scale proportionately. The user will be able to zoom in on text of an item by clicking the appropriate day or hovering their mouse over the item.
