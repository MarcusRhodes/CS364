## 4.3 Validate Usability Requirements

Gathering a group of 20 users, the usability requirements will be validated by having each of them successfully add, modify, and remove an assignment. The users must also successfully add, modify, and remove an event item. Finally, the users must be able to navigate between the main calendar view, daily calendar view, to-do list, and help menu. Another step in validating usability requirements will be to use a UI Test Harness that will verify that the XPath used in the UI is usability compliant. A full round of usability testing and validation will be performed to confirm that the whole application can be used by the intended audience of users.
