## 4.1 Verify External Interface Requirements

All externally facing applications that integrate with this software will have validation and verification built into the application to verify that these third-party applications are up and running at the time the user attempts to use them. If they are down a friendly error message will be displayed indicating the problem and provide feedback as to what they can do to address the issue. This could be from “Please try again” to “Please contact support and report the error”.

Though in most cases this is a message designed to help the user feel good about their experience all errors will be logged in our error tracking database which error reporting and monitoring can be automatically driven.
