### 4.2.55 User Task List

Validation will be successful if the user has added tasks to be shown in this list then it is shown on the main screen of the app. As an example, I add 2 assignments to show on the top of the main page of the app they should come  up in a list at the top so that they can be clicked on to show details.

#### 4.2.55.1 Assignment List

Adding Assignments - Assignments need to have a button to be able to display on main screen.

Displaying Assignments - Assignments should be displayed by order of priority and class. If i have two assignments, one has priority the other does not, then the one with priority shows first. As well if there are several assignments from one class they should all be shown together.

Empty List - If there are no assignments to display in the User Task list, then a page should be displayed that says "No assignments to display".
