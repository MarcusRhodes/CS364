#### 4.2.42.1 Help with class

Testers will test this feature to ensure that only appropriate links are listed under the class help.  If a user has not enrolled in any classes then this feature will not contain any links and will instead alert the user that they have no class help available.  An error message will be displayed if a link is broken alerting the user that the link is broken.  If there is no help available for a given class then the user will recieve an alert letting them know that no help is available for that class.
