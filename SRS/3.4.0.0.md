## 3.4 Performance Requirements

The calendar application will be hosted in the cloud using elastic services that will provide automatic scaleability of required resources for the application to remain performant. This means that when load on the system increases servers and resources will automatically be allocated by the cloud hosting service such as AWS or Azure and reduced when they are no longer required.

These performance metrics are dependent upon the user having a stable and reliable Internet connection.

The Student Calendar must be interactive with delays in action-response functionality kept to a minimum. When opening window forms or displaying error messages, the delay should be less than 5 seconds. When accessing the user account database, the operation of opening user preferences, sorting user items, and displaying the user calendar will be performed under 5 seconds. Time to Connect to the server will be based on the distance between the user's machine and the server but the application will determine if the connection is successful within 20 seconds.
