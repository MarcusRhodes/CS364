### 4.2.36 Database for Account Usernames and Passwords

Validation will be successful if the database contains all the users of the application stored in a secure manner. If for any reason the account usernames or passwords are compromised, the database will be locked until the database security is reinsured and users reset their username and password.

#### 4.2.36.1 Verifying Existing Account

A tester will create a new account. The user will then login to their account with the credentials they created. If the user is unable to remember their username or password they may recover it through the phone or e-mail that is connected with the account. After failing to correctly log in 10 times within 5 minutes from the same session, then the account will be locked from that session for 24 hours or until the user resets their password. The user will be notified through their e-mail of the attempt.

#### 4.2.36.2 Create New Account

A tester will create a new account. The account will be inserted into the database in a secure manner. If the username already exists, the web page will display a message informing the user that the username is taken, and to try again with another username.
