### 4.2.45 Quick Access

The quick access feature will contain links to the users classes.  Validation will be successful if links redirect correctly to the specific classes.  This feature will also be tested to ensure that the links redirect to the correct classes.

### 4.2.45.1 Quick Access Class Selection

Testers will test this feature by ensuring that each link contained in the quick access feature redirect to the correct class.  If the user has no classes then they will receive an error message alerting them that there are no availble classes.  If a link is broken then there will be an error message that tells the user that the link is not working.
