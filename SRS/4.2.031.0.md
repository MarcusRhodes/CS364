### 4.2.31 Group Permissions

Validation will be successful if the user can set restrictions and permissions within their groups. These permissions include the ability to do the following tasks, and will each be tested for.

 1. The user can give group announcements.
 2. The user can write in group chat.
 3. The user can schedule meetings.
 4. The user can accept members into the group.
 5. The user can make group links.
 6. The user can give group permissions to other users.

#### 4.2.31.1 Group owners have access to all the groups resources

This will be tested by creating a group, becoming the group owner, and inviting another tester to the group. The tester will verify that they can perform each of the group tasks as listed above. They will verify that the permissions can be given to the group member. The tester will verify that if there are no assignments that the group page says: "No group work!"

#### 4.2.31.2 Group members can be aware of what is happening in their group

Validation will be successful when permissions are set and group is aware of those permissions given or set. In addition, the group member verifies they can see the announcements from the group. If there are no assignments they will verify that the page says: "No group work!"
