### 3.2.54 Task Rewards

The user has the option of enabling a rewards system to serve as a motivator to complete tasks and assignments. Students need to feel that they are making progress, so this reward system will allow users to earn experience points and see a progress bar when they complete tasks and assignments. More points will be awarded if assignments and tasks are completed on time.
