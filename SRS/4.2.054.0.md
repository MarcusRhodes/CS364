### 4.2.54 Task Rewards

Verification will be successful if points are awarded successfully for completing tasks and assignments.

#### 4.2.54.1 Goal/XP Bar

Clicking on the Adventure Mode of the app should make a section appear on the sidebar containing information about percentage completion and experience points (XP) to be awarded. Users will be able to enter the amount of points they want to earn for completing tasks and assignments. Only positive integers can be entered. The system will be tested to verify that no negative integers, letters, or character symbols are allowed to be entered. Consequently, the system will be tested to verify that it alerts the user once an invalid input is entered. 

A test will be performed to verify that points are awarded once assignments are marked as complete. The Goal/XP Bar will be tested to verify that exact progression is recorded. For example, if the user has only five assignments during a week,and two of those assignments are marked complete, then the goal bar should show that it is 40% complete. Points will also be awarded. In the example above, if the user had assigned 20 points to assignments, then the user should see that 20 points were awarded per assignment completed for a total of 40 XP points. Similarly, tasks will be worth whatever amount of points the users deem apropriate.
